# React + TypeScript + Vite

Imported dependancies: React Icons, Tailwind, shadcn-ui, axios and gh-pages

The cards are displayed using an API from OMDB.
The title is then passed into the description component as props which is then used to search another API from TMDB
to get the description from there.

The project is meant as a guide to practise the usage of multiple APIs.

Axios had to be used for the TMDB one but regular fetch for the OMDB.
